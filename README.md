# Front-End-Nanodegree [archived]

This is the initial front end nanodegree repository which is _archived_ right now! When I was starting the udacity nanodegree my plan is to use only one repository for all nanodegree projects. As I know that in the near future, I am end up having a lots of repositories and managing them would be challenging.

But later on due to some reasons, I have to use individual repository for each project.

## Here is a list of projects
- [project1 - portfolio site](https://github.com/rehanumar/p1-portfolio-site)
- [project2 - online resume](https://github.com/rehanumar/p2-online-resume)
- [project3 - classic arcade game](https://github.com/rehanumar/p3-classic-arcade-game)
- [project4 - website optimization](https://github.com/rehanumar/p4-website-optimization)
- [project5 - neighborhood map](https://github.com/rehanumar/p5-neighborhood-map)
- [project6 - feed reader testing](https://github.com/rehanumar/p6-feed-reader-testing)
